All of the tests are in the RecipeCalculatorTest.java file.

The user provides a file that contains the ingredients, and then files that contain recipes. 

The command to run the application is (for example):
java RecipeCalculatorTest "ingredients.txt" "saladdressing.txt" "chickenbreast.txt" "pastafiesta.txt"

The main function includes several tests of the nearestCent and nearestSeventhCent methods. It also tests a recipe with a bogus item that is otherwise identical to the chicken breast recipe.
